# SimpleATM 

SimpleATM is a basic console-based ATM simulation written in Java.  
It was built as a learning project to better understand how Java handles user input, decision making, and program flow.

## What This Program Does?
After entering a correct PIN, the user can interact with a simple ATM menu to:

- Check the current balance  
- Deposit money  
- Withdraw money (with balance validation)  
- Exit the system safely  

All interactions happen through the console.

## Technologies & Concepts

This project uses:

- Java
- Scanner for user input
- Conditional statements (if / switch)
- Loops (while)
- Basic algorithmic thinking

This screenshot shows a sample use of the SimpleATM application running through a terminal. When the program starts, the user is is asked to enter a PIN for security. The user can log in by entering their correct PIN, which is 1234. After logging in, an ATM menu with four main options is displayed. <br> <br>
In the image, the user selects the "Check Balance" option in the first step, and the system clearly displays the initial balance as $1000.0. The menu is then shown again, indicating that the program continues running and waits for the user to perform another action. <br> <br>
In the next step, the user selects the “Deposit” option and deposits $300. When the balance is checked again, the updated amount of $1300.0 is displayed.This proves that the user's deposit transaction has been processed correctly.
