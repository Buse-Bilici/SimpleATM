# SimpleATM 

SimpleATM is a basic console-based ATM simulation written in Java.  
It was built as a learning project to better understand how Java handles user input, decision making, and program flow.

## What This Program Does?
After entering a correct PIN, the user can interact with a simple ATM menu to:

- Check the current balance  
- Deposit money  
- Withdraw money (with balance validation)  
- Exit the system safely  

All interactions happen through the console.

## Technologies & Concepts

This project uses:

- Java
- Scanner for user input
- Conditional statements (if / switch)
- Loops (while)
- Basic algorithmic thinking
